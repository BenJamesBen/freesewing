title: Where to find web page files in the repository
order: 200
---

With the exception of blog posts, showcase posts, and newsletters,
all of our web pages can be found in our repository on GitHub.

## Design documentation

Documentation for our designs are found in the `/markdown/org/docs/patterns` directory.
Each design has its own subdirectory.

Within each design subdirectory are 4 additional subdirectories,
each corresponding to a documentation page:

1. `cutting` for cutting instructions
2. `fabric` for fabric options
3. `instructions` for construction instructions
4. `needs` for what the sewist will need to construct the pattern

These documentation pages will appear to readers in this order.
If you have additional information you want to convey, you will need
to include it in one of these 4 documentation pages.

## FreeSewing.org

FreeSewing.org documentation is found in the `/markdown/org/docs` directory.

Markdown for other web pages on FreeSewing.org can be found in the `/markdown/org/ui` directory.

(Blog posts, showcase posts, and newsletters are found on Strapi.
Link to Strapi docs.)

## FreeSewing.dev

FreeSewing.dev documentation is found in the `/markdown/dev` directory,
under the subdirectories for
`guides`, `howtos`, `reference`, and `tutorials`.
