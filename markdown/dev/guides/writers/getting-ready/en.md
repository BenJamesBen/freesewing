Before you can create and edit web page files, there are a few steps
you will need to take. There are two types of content:

1. Regular web pages on FreeSewing.org and FreeSewing.dev, including
design and developer documentation.
2. Blog posts, showcase posts, and newsletters.

## Get a GitHub account

FreeSewing's web page files are kept in our GitHub repository.
You will need to sign up for a GitHub account to be able to edit them.
(Link to GitHub documentation in Coders Guide.)

Our blog, showcases, and newsletters are maintained in Strapi.
You will need to sign up for a Strapi account to be able to edit them.
