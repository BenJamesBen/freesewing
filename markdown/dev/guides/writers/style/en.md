## FreeSewing

This is the _desired state_ regarding how we like to see FreeSewing when
seen in text.

- "FreeSewing" should be styled with the "F" and "S" capitalized.
- This "FreeSewing" capitalization is also used in website names
  when they are mentioned in the text,
  for example "FreeSewing.org" and "FreeSewing.dev".
- But, feel free to use all lowercase letters when they are used in
  URLs, for example "https://freesewing.dev/reference/api".
- Also, "freesewing" without capitalization is used in package names,
  the GitHub account name, and other case-sensitive/coding applications.
  Please keep the name in all lowercase letters for these situations.
- Finally, the name of the project/group/organization itself is
  "FreeSewing", not "FreeSewing.org" (which is used only when referring
  to the actual website).

## Proper nouns and abbreviations

Below are the spellings and styled capitalizations that the official
organizations use for their proper nouns and abbreviations.

- CSS, JSON, SVG, YAML (all letters capitalized)
- Node.js, Next.js
  ("N" capitalized, "js" lowercase, not "Node" or "Node JS" or "NodeJS")
- React, Markdown, Strapi, Crowdin, Frontmatter, Prisma, Gitpod, Unix, Linux
  (only the first letter capitalized for these)
- SQLite (the "SQL" capitalized for this)
- GitHub ("G" and "H" capitalized, not "Github")
- JavaScript ("J" and "S" capitalized, not "Javascript" or "javascript")
- macOS ("OS" capitalized, not "Mac OS" or "mac OS")

## Jargon

These are words that might not be found in dictionaries but are accepted
jargon used in their fields.

- Sewing and fashion: "womenswear", "menswear", "sleevecap", "grainline",
  "outseam", "underbust"
- Technology: "truthy", "falsy", "backend", "frontend", "config",
  "monorepo", "serverless", "runtime", "lockfile"
- FreeSewing-specific variations: "Howto" ("H" capitalized), "measies",
  "scalebox", "miniscale", "bnotch", "cutlist", "multiset"
- Other acceptable words: - "startpoint", "endpoint"
  (Or, should we standardize on "start point" and "end point"?)

## Numbers and units

- There should be a space character between numbers and SI units when
  they appear in text.
  For example, "5 cm" and "1.3 mm", rather than "5cm" and "1.3mm".
- The exception is when these values are used in CSS and SVG code.
  The CSS and SVG specifications require that no space character be
  used in these situations.

## Bézier

- "Bézier" with a capital "B" and an acute accent mark over the "é"
   is used to describe Bézier curves and Pierre Bézier.
- "Bezier" with a capital "B" and unaccented "e" is used to describe
  the Bezier class used in code.
- "bezier" without capitalization is used for case-sensitive package names.

## Other preferred spellings

- "lifecycle" when specifically referring to the stages that the
  FreeSewing technology goes through when it runs and generates a pattern.
- "whitespace" when specifically used to describe computer whitespace
  characters,
  (while "white space" is generically used to describe spacing before and
  after words or lines).
- "bartack" when specifically referring to the element from the FreeSewing
  plugin,
  ("bar tack" when otherwise referring to the generic sewing or pattern
  feature)
  (Or, is the spelling "bartack" accepted sewing jargon?)
- "cutonfold" when specifically referring to the element from the
  FreeSewing plugin,
  ("cut-on-fold" when otherwise referring to the line in patterns)
- "stand-alone", not "standalone".
- "line break", not "linebreak".
- "website", not "web site".
- "pop-up", not "popup"
